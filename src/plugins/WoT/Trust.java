	 * The edition number of the trust list in which this trust was published the last time.
	 * This is used to speed up the import of new trust lists: When importing them, we need to delete removed trust values. We cannot just
	 * delete all trust values of the truster from the database  and then import the trust list because deleting a trust causes recalculation
	 * of the score of the trustee. So for trust values which were not really removed from the trust list we would recalculate the score twice:
	 * One time when the old trust object is deleted and one time when the new trust is imported. Not only that we might recalculate one
	 * time without any necessity, most of the time even any recalculation would not be needed because the trust value has not changed.
	 * 
	 * To prevent this, we do the following: When creating new trusts, we store the edition number of the trust list from which we obtained it.
	 * When importing a new trust list, for each trust value we query the database whether a trust value to this trustee already exists and 
	 * update it if it does - we also update the trust list edition member variable. After having imported all trust values we query the 
	 * database for trust objects from the truster which have an old trust list edition number and delete them - the old edition number
	 * means that the trust has been removed from the latest trust list.
